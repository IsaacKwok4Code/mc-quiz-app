# Multiple Choice Quiz Component

Build a Multiple Choice question question component.

Decide:

* What needs to be props and what needs to state
* Where state needs to live
* How interactivity will be handled

Then, create a quiz and keep track of the state of the answers. Note that you may need to refactor your question component to move state as a result.
